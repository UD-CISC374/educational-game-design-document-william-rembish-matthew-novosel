# Type Warriors: Unleashed

## Elevator Pitch

You are a warrior in a dangerous world with enemies abound. You will use your typing knowledge to traverse each battlefield and deliver a multitude of attacks and defenses to your enemies to emerge victorious or perish along the way.

## Influences (Brief)

- Typing of the Dead
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: Typing of the Dead uses typing in words to attack enemies. This game also uses the concept of typing to control the game and interact with enemies in different ways.
- For Honor
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: In For Honor, attack and block directions are very important. You need to match the direction of the opponents attack in order to successfully block said attack. This is the basis of the idea of being able to react to an enemies attack with the correct directional block.
- Final Fantasy
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: Final Fantasy has a medieval, fantasy style to the game and allows you to use money you get from defeating enemies to purchase equipment and spells. In our game, you are a medieval warrior who is able to collect money for equipment and spells by defeating enemies.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Move around the battlefield by typing in a command to do so. e.g. "move forward", "step back", "dodge left"
- Perform various attacks and defences with typing commands such as "swing right hand", "cast fireball", "block left swing"
- A mistype causes the type input to stop, the letter you messed up on turns red, and you can't type another command for a brief moment
- Whenever the enemy uses a command, you have a short indicated timeframe to react to their command. e.g. enemy: "swing left hand" player: "block left swing"
- Defeating an enemy gives you gold. Gold can be used to buy equipment,spells, and upgrades at the shop.

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

Typing speed and accuracy

## Target Audiences

Our taget audience would be anyone who wants to improve their typing skills, ranging from k-12 students to adults who haven't really developed their typing skills. The mild violence would probably not make it recommended for younger kids.

## Target Contexts

- This would be a good assignment for typing classes as a homework assignment or possibly classwork assignment.

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to maximize their WPM(Words Per Minute) when typing.
- By the end of the lesson, players will be able to create documents of text rapidly and accurately when typing.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- Prior to the game, players need to have basic knowledge of the keyboard keys layout.
- Prior to the game, players need to be able to spell simple words such as "move", "swing", "cast", etc.


## Assessment Measures

A pre-test that assesses the current speed and accuracy of the learners typing, followed by a post-test to measure improvements of the learner.
- You could use existing tools such as typingtest.com to assess the learners typing skills pre and post gameplay.

# What sets this project apart?

- Most, if not all, games out there that try to teach typing skills involve typing some word that appears on the screen to perform attacks, wheras our game has the player typing in commands to perform actions relevant to those commands. 
- The gameplay mechanics are more naturally interconnected with the learning mechanics because you are not simply typing random words that appear on the screen that are irrelevent to what you are doing, the words are relavent to what is going on in the actual game.

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

This is a game primarily for one person, although there might be an optional pvp mode where you can fight another player. The player types in different commands to interact with the worldspace and the other actors in said worldspace.

## Player Modes

- Single-player: You battle progressively harder enemies where the player has lower reaction timers the more enemies you beat. You can upgrade your equipment and abilities at the shop with gold earned by defeating enemies.
- PVP: Play against a friend, where the reaction timers are set to a reasonably short time and you both have equivalent items and abilities. See who is the best typer between the two of you.

## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*
